## TESTING

### Guidelines for Unit Tests

#### KARMA + JASMINE

- Use TestBed for configuring the testing module
- Prefer shallow tests with mocks for external services
- Use fakeAsync/tick for async timing control
- Keep specs deterministic and fast
- Use spies to isolate side effects
- Prefer async/await with waitForAsync for async setup
- Reset TestBed between suites when needed
- Use focused matchers (toEqual, toBeTruthy, toContain)
- Keep one component/service as the primary subject per spec file
